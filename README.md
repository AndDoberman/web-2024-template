## Make changes

```
Instead of a todo list app, make an app to store and edit recipes for dishes.
Allow to recalculate number of portions for each dish.
Populate with 5 boilerplate dishes.
Make funky styling.
```

Try writing in your mother tongue - it may work out, idk.

Hit Enter, then once it's done - hit Acccept All and reload your live demo in the browser.

## Tips

- Break down functionality into smallest possible bits. Don't bundle several unrelated features: you'll increase the probability of an app crash and your lost time
- Once a Cursor made any small step in the right direction - commit and push
- If Cursor broke things: better Reject All and start from the last commit
- Press "+" to start a new Composer and erase unnecessary previous context. Cursor knows what you did before because it looks into the current code
